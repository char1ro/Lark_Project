Hello there, welcome to the Facility, A game created by me Charlie Ross

Here are some basic instructions (you will learn more as you progress):
use the command ls (name of directory)to check the files/directories in a directory a.k.a. search rooms or area
use the command cd (name of directory)to go from directory to directory (the dark blue things) a.k.a. moving from room to room
use the command cat (name of file) to read what a file has to say a.k.a. look at an item
